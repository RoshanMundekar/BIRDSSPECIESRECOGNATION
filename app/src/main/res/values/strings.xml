    <string name="about_clg">BIRD behavior and population trends have become an important issue now a days. Birds help us to detect other organisms in the environment (e.g. insects they feed on) easily as they respond quickly to the environmental changes [2]. But, gathering and collecting information about birds requires huge human effort as well as becomes a very costlier method. In such case, a reliable system that will provide large scale processing of information about birds and will serve as a valuable tool for researchers, governmental agencies, etc. is required. So, bird species identification plays an important role in identifying that a particular image of bird belongs to which species. Bird species identification means predicting the bird species belongs to which category by using an image.</string>
